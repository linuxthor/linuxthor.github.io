William Rowland Ding
                                            1885 - 1917

 William Rowland Ding was born on the 19th August 1885 in Alsager Cheshire. Rowland’s Father, William Ding, was Rector of the Parish, an important figure in the local community.

 The young Rowland was said to be always busy “inventing things” and showed a great aptitude for engineering subjects. 

 Rowland was educated at St Edmunds Clergy School, Canterbury.  Rowland’s father died while he was a teenager. Rowland continued his studies at the Finsbury Technical College where he studied electrical engineering under Professor Silvanus Thompson. 

 As would be reported many years later in ‘The Olympian’ - internal magazine of Blackburn Aircraft Company: 

“..Philosophical habits and a love for mechanics were strangely intertwined in the only Son from early boyhood. Little wonder, therefore, that in his scholastic career so rosily begun at St Edmunds, Canterbury, he willfully omitted the university “finish” so often planned for him by his mother and went direct to a collegiate course in London, where for his study of the  applied sciences he had a friend and tutor in Silvanus Thompson, the well known scientific engineer...” 

Silvanus Thompson was a popular professor and the author of several books. Studying under Professor Thompson was a major draw and brought many students to the imposing building that was the Finsbury Technical College (described in the book ‘Silvanus Phillips Thompson – His Life and Letters’ as “a dingy-looking stone building in harmony with it’s surroundings” the neighbourhood where it was located drawing praise only for “being central for trams and railways from the outlying suburbs of London.”)    

 Admission into Finsbury Technical College required the passing of a challenging entrance examination, however, even for those who could meet the academic standard a place wasn’t guaranteed as there were were many more students than places and the college could afford to be selective. Students were typically 16 or older (it was rare for those younger than 16 to pass the exam but there are cases of 14 or 15 year olds attending) 

Tuition at the college was intensely practical. It’s said in the book “The Present Operations of Finsbury Technical College” that every hour of lecture was complimented by two hours of practical work and (surprisingly for someone who had published books..) Silvanus Thompson rejected almost all textbook use. Silvanus Thompson aspired to produce people who could work in new and emerging technical fields and his stated goal was to replace a 5-6 year apprenticeship with 2 years of dedicated work. There was no outside exam or assesment to be passed. After the course was complete a certificate of proficiency was issued – the reputation of having studied under Thompson being enough to open many doors.  

 At the age of 19 Rowland Ding found himself running a large electricity generating station on behalf of London County Council. 

 As later reported in The Olympian magazine it was at this time he became interested in flight: 

“..He continued at his studies for some years and acquired no small reputation as a lecturer on engineering subjects; and when the world first began to talk of the coming conquest of the air, the new science of aviation instantly gripped his imagination. Indeed, his maiden extempore speech in a London hall was devoted to this fascinating subject..” 

 While Ding was a student and a newly qualified Electrical Engineer he lived in East and then North East London  however by 1905 he had moved to Newcastle where he based himself for about two years and it is believed he was managing an Electricity Generating station there. It is said that he first spent some time as a Colliery Engineer in Wales before taking that role but the exact dates he was there are unknown. 

By 1907 Ding, still a registered Electrical Engineer was living in South East London and it was at Balham Hill ascension church that he married Victoria Constance Mason, the two having a daughter - Aphra Constance Rowland Ding together the next year while the family were living in Mitcham, Surrey.  

 While Ding was busy settling into family life something important was happening in the world of flight. Several years earlier in 1903 the Wright Brothers had managed to achieve some of the first powered flights but their successes weren’t universally believed. The quest to achieve flight had, by this time, attracted a lot of unusual people and wild claims so this was just another unproven claim, especially in France where it appeared that the greatest progress was being made. In 1908 all this changed when the Wright Brothers came to France and made a short exhibition flight that proved their claim.  

 After the Wright Brothers flew in France there was an explosion of interest in flying. A few months later the American Samuel Franklin Cody became the first man to fly in England. The larger than life former Wild West Circus Performer Cody was an aviation pioneer known for the ‘man lifting kites’ he developed for military applications. These early flights were short and barely under the control of the pilot who would operate some sort of system of ropes from an exposed position on top of the plane!

 Alongside an interest in powered flight there was a related craze at this time for model aircraft making. These were lightweight models usually powered by thick rubber band motors wound dozens of times. The goal was to achieve as long and stable flight as possible but the means of achieving that was entirely up to individual creativity and understanding of the theory and predictably many of these models bore little resemblance to the full sized counterparts and some were as aerodynamic as a brick. 

 Around this time, in 1909, the name Ding first began to be known in the model aircraft community. There are a few other names who were associated with Ding in those days, chief among them was William Higley “W. H.” Sayers. Another member of Ding’s model making group was the artist Clifford Fleming-Williams who created numerous unique and interesting designs - some of which were extremely successful in achieving records for distance and flight time. All the model makers in this group became household names in the model aircraft community of the time due to their original designs and success in competitions. 

 The Ding and Sayers partnership was soon formalised as they went into business together selling model making supplies. The two took out a patent together in March of 1910 in both England and France on their ideas about lateral stability in aircraft. Ding-Sayers Company of Elm Gardens, Mitcham, Surrey. marketed the basic materials such as propellers, rubber band motors, wood and wires to make a wide range of different scratch-built models and self-assembly kits of Ding, Sayers and Fleming-Williams models.
 



 In 1910 and 1911 Ding, Sayers and Fleming-Williams all did well in model aircraft competitions. The ‘Ding-Sayers’ and ‘Fleming-Williams’ models were well known with the ‘Ding-Sayers’ looking like nothing else around at the time, combining innovative design features - including an ability to take off from the ground under it’s own power - with long flight times. The ‘Fleming-Williams’ was a design that spawned numerous copycats, Fleming-Williams having invented a number of ideas that became standard on models. Ding, Sayers and Fleming-Williams all wrote to magazines at the time talking about their models and it seems they were very successful.  

 The Ding-Sayers design that took first prize in a competition was described as follows in in The Aeroplane magazine:

“..This year, for example, the most progressive feature is most decidedly the capacity for rising from the ground demonstrated by the Ding-Sayers model […] The little Ding-Sayers machine not only flew beautifully, but would rise from the ground every time, even though the floor was rough concrete. Moreover the place where the flights were made was full of obstructions, and sooner or later the models would be sure to dash full speed into something hard; but although every effort was made  in this way to break up the Ding-Sayers flyer under conditions that might quite well be experienced in practice, only a single wire came adrift, and that was only unhooked, so it could be replaced without necessitating any sort of structural repair. As an engineering construction on a small scale therefore, the Ding-Sayers model was quite worthy of notice, and as a design of biplane it is distinctly interesting as an adaptation of modern methods to the requirements of models..”

  When Ding made a visit to Ireland in 1910 and gave a demonstration of model flying in Phoenix Park, Dublin, he told the crowd that the models he was showing were, in some cases, a miniature replica of a full sized aircraft which was under construction at the Ding-Sayers company in Surrey. It’s not known how close this project got to completion but it was certainly not finished. The problem many aircraft designer/builders had at this time wasn’t building an airframe but rather obtaining the necessary light but powerful engine to complete it.  

 At the time of the 1911 census the Ding family were guests of the family of Fredrick Montague Dobbs, his wife and two daughters and son in Gunnersby, West London. Fredrick Dobbs listed his occupation as ‘Pianoforte Tuner’ and Ding indicated he was an ‘Aeronautical Engineer’ - at the age of 25 Rowland Ding was already established within the emerging aviation industry, having decided to pursue this dream rather than continue with the comfortable electrical engineering roles he’d spent the last few years working in. 

 In January of 1912 Rowland Ding wrote a letter to a magazine and mentioned in it that he had a model that weighed 5 lbs that could take off in 6 feet and another weighing 6 oz that could take off in 3 feet both over “lumpy grass on the common” so it seems like, whatever construction of a full sized aircraft was taking place, it did nothing to slow Rowland’s interest in model aircraft. 

 Claude Graham-White was a  larger than life character with enough money to afford all the toys he wanted: cars, motorcycles and now aircraft. While most people would consider themselves fortunate at this time to have just one of those Claude had multiple of each. When he became interested in flying after witnessing some short flights in France he immediately sought out tuition there and made contacts who could supply him with aircraft. After learning to fly and briefly operating a flying school in France (‘The English School’) Graham-White returned to Britain and took it as his personal mission to promote flying. As part of his efforts he established Hendon Aerodrome as a centre for flying in England.

 Hendon started out as a small grass aerodrome with one or two buildings where experimental flying could take place, but quickly grew to attract large crowds keen to see the sight of powered flight and before long more formal programs were put in place where the top names in early aviation would give demonstrations and admission would be charged. The popularity of this form of of entertainment lead to the site at Hendon Aerodrome growing to several buildings, paddocks, stands etc. Hendon quickly became known internationally as the home of flying in England. 
 
 Crowds came to Hendon in large numbers to see the thrilling spectacle of early flights which were sometimes rough and uncontrolled with malfunctions and pilot errors being relatively common. Even when the flights were perfectly executed it was still exciting to see pilots land ‘vol plane’ (essentially cutting the engine and drifting down to the ground!) People soon travelled from all over London and arrived either on foot or in cars. At a time when there would be only a few cars on the road at any time there are photographs showing dozens parked at Hendon watching the flights. For those with more money to spend they could ask to go up for a short flight. Some people became addicted to this thrill taking several flights week after week.  

  It’s not known how Claude Graham-White and Rowland Ding first became aquaninted but it seems that Graham-White ran a sort of ‘incubator’ for early aircraft companies at Hendon with workshop space being available to some emerging makers so it may be that he was there in conjunction with the Ding-Sayers company or perhaps as an independent designer/constructor of aircraft. What is known with some certainty is that by April of 1912 Rowland Ding was working on designing an experimental aircraft for Graham-White. This was a 35 HP monoplane said to be almost silent. 

Flight magazine described the new aircraft as follows:

“..The Grahame-White works at Hendon have now under con-
struction a miniature racing monoplane to be equipped with one of
the new 35-h.p. Y-type Anzani motors. Its fuselage is to be of
torpedo form, and a combination wheel and skid chassis of quite a
new type is to be fitted..”



In the Sheffield Daily Telegraph 26th September the plane was mentioned:

“..What is described as a silent monoplane is now to be seen at Hendon. It’s designer Mr W. Rowland Ding claims for it’s strength, silence and speed. He says the monoplane can be driven at full speed yet the engines will be inaudible at a distane of 100 yards..” 

This project was substantially complete by September of 1912 and photographs exist of the finished aircraft. It is believed that, after the plane was test flown in a September Hendon meeting, it was considered to have failed to meet expectations and wasn’t seen or heard about again (the official history of the Graham-White company hardly mentions it) the 35 h.p. Anzani engine seemingly being reused in a different project the next spring. 

 The events of the test flight at the September Hendon meeting were reported in Flight magazine: 

“..while the event of the day was the appearance of the new Graham-White monoplane designed by Mr Ding. Although on more or less conventional lines this little monoplane, posesses several original and interesting features. The principal of these is the fitting of a streamlined silencer with a 35 h.p “Y” Anzani engine. The overall length of the monoplane is about 24 ft and the span is 31 ft. Marcel Desoutter occupied the pilot’s seat, and after a preliminary run of the engine gave the signal to let go. In a few hundred yards the monoplane was seen to rise off the ground and thus continue until the end of the aerodrome was reached, when Desoutter switched off – Flash! Bang!! It was only a backfire in the silencer but Desoutter didn’t know this and promptly came down; he turned the machine around and flew back towards the sheds finishing with another Brock’s Benefit display..” 

(Note: A “Brock’s Benefit refers to a firework display.)

 Dings friend and colaborator W.H Sayers took a job around this time as Chief Engineer for A.V Roe company (Avro.) He seems to have also spent some time working and living in Portugal initially in relation to an Avro order from the Portugese government but then deciding to stay on and take work at a flying school there. Either due to Ding and Sayers being busy with their careers or progress in model aircraft design the Ding-Sayers model airplanes appear to have diminished in popularity at this point. Magazines of the time occasionally referring to them as older designs that had now been obsoleted or expanded upon. It seems like it was around this time the Ding-Sayers company became simply the Ding model company, based in Birmingham. 

 Whatever the relationship between Ding and Graham-White had been it was certainly very much over by January of 1913 when B.C Hucks advertised for a manager. Benfield Charles Hucks was part of a new breed of travelling flight show. Recognising that thousands flocked to places like Hendon each year the idea of a travelling show emerged. Some land would be obtained, probably a farmers field and an exhibition would be given for a small amount of money. Just as at Hendon it was possible to pay extra to go up on a short flight and many paid for the privilege.  

“..Mr. B. C. Hucks, the well-known Bleriot flyer, whose
sound and steady handling of his two-seater monoplane
is always a delight to watch, has arranged to give
exhibitions at Lincoln on Wednesday, Tanuary 22nd,
and on the Friday and Saturday following. That exhi-
bition finished, he intends going on to Norwich, but the
date for the latter place is not yet definitely fixed up.
By the way, he tells me that he is looking out for a
reliable manager to whom he can trust all arrangements
connected with his flying exhibitions. I shall only be too
willing to see that letters sent to Mr. Hucks, care of
FLIGHT offices, are forwarded to the proper quarter..” (Flight Magazine - January 18th 1913) 

 When Hucks advertised for a manager I imagine he got a lot of responses but Rowland Ding might perhaps have stood out due to his knowledge of the theory of aircraft design and having previously given lectures and demonstrations with models. Just three days after Hucks advert was published he gave a show in Lincoln with Rowland Ding as his manager and a few days later Ding gave a lecture to explain how everything worked. No doubt this was a winning combination. 

The Lincolnshire Echo reported on 25th January 1913: 

“..One of the most interesting and helpful features of the visit of Mr Hucks, the famous aviator, to the city was the lecture which his manager (Mr Rowland Ding) gave on aviation in the Theatre  of the Municipal Technical School last evening, and it was an eloquent testimony to the popularity which the exhibitions have secured locally that there should be a crowded attendance. The audience were more than rewarded, for the lecture was throughout decidedly interesting and completely instructive, Mr Ding being a thorough master of the scientific  as well as the practical side of aviation. For an hour and a half he kept the audience, by speech, diagram and lantern slide, intensely interested in the subject. 

[...]

 Mr Rowland Ding dealt with several of the problems connected with aviation and aeroplanes and said flying had been considered possible for a great many years, but there was no engine made or designed which would give sufficient power without being too heavy to be lifted. He traced the evolutions in the science of aviation from the days of gliders down the the most up-to-date machine, and illustrated the various phases of progress by pictures of the various types of flying machines in their order of date. Recent improvements in the petrol engine, he declared, had made flying not only possible, but reasonably safe. (Applause.) Following this, the lecturer showed the construction of an aeroplane, and what it is capable of doing. He divided the aeroplane into four parts – the weighr carrying part, which carried the pilot; the wings, which supported the machine in flight and were the second most important; the propeller for for giving the machine forward power through the air; and the engine for driving the propeller. 

 One of the most interesting portions of the whole lecture was that in which Mr Ding illustrated how lift was created, and how the stability of the machine when in the air was secured, proving by mathematical reasoning how the lateral stability was secured while the flight was in progress. This argument finished, he had projected on the screen a series of pictures of different forms of aeroplanes, these including several representations of Mr Hucks in his monoplane. He described the  Gnome engine as the most successful one on account of it’s light weight and it’s very great stability, and showed a picture of Mr Hucks holding a 50 h.p. Gnome to prove it’s lightness. 

[..]

 Mr Ding stated that England wanted bucking up in the matter of aviation. In France people were absolutely enthusiastic about flying, and meant to make their country keep ahead of all others. It was up to us Englishmen to see that they did not do it. 

[..]

 Before the audience dispersed Mr Ding made paper models of aeroplanes, which he sent flying about the room to illustrate the ease with which motion could be secured...” 

 By Feburary of 1913 Ding was managing the tour of another pilot, the Australian, Sidney Pickles.  In anticipation of Pickles arriving in Gloucester in March the local Gloucestershire Chronicle wrote:

“..This airman, who only came to England from Australia to learn flying two years ago, is said to be one of the most remarkable exhibition flyers the world has yet seen. Mr Pickles learned to fly at Brooklands on a Bristol monoplane, which was at that time considered one of the most intricate machines. Since then he has made a name for himself as one of the most daring Hendon aviators, and has flown on every type of aeroplane. Mr Pickles intends to make an extended summer tour, and he is making Gloucester his starting place. He will use a Bleriot monoplane with an extra powerful engine of 60-80 h.p.

 Mr Rowland Ding of the Royal Aero Club who is making the arrangements for the exhibition is now in the city, and in an interview with a representative of “the Chronicle” he said that Mr Pickles would introduce many novel features into his flights as Gloucester. In the first place he will carry passengers – the only exhibition flyer who does. He hopes to have a good number of passengers while in the district. He will also give exhibitions of bomb dropping at a target placed on the ground. He will do some despatch carrying, for which his time will be taken, while he will also give demonstrations of speed and fancy flying. Mr Pickles already holds last seasons height record at Hendon (6,950 feet) and while at Gloucester he endeavors to beat the Midlands height record of 7,000 feel set by Mr B. C. Hucks. He will fly over several towns in the neighbourhood, and will drop bills advertising his flights. 

[...]

An excellent site for the aerodrome has been secured in a field near the brickworks at Llanthony, the prices of admission to which are strictly moderate. Flying will commence on Good Friday afternoon and will be continued on Saturday afternoon, and all day Easter Monday beginning at eleven o’clock in the morning. Mr Pickles is due to arrive in Gloucester on Tuesday, and will bring the aeroplane by road, at the back of a motor-car. On arrival in Gloucester it will be toured through the town and afterwards will be on show at Messers Healey’s showrooms...” 
..”

 The Gloucesteshire Chronicle later wrote: 

“..The inhabitants of the city of Gloucester and the immediate neighbourhood have during the past week had another opportunity of learning something of aviation through the visit of Mr. Sidney Pickles with his 60-80 h.p. Anzani Bleriot Monoplane. Mr Pickles was to have commenced operations of Good Friday, but owing to the fact that his machine – a new one – got damaged in transit, no flying took place until Sunday. On that day, in direct contrast to the previous two days, the sun shone brightly, and Mr. Pickles, with his able manager (Mr. Rowland Ding) and party, was soon at Hucclecote, inspecting the aeroplane and giving it the finishing touches. Much water had accumulated in the tent, and the wind had played much havoc with the hangar, but happily had not damaged the plane. The machine was taken into the field where it attracted much attention. All the morning and a good part of the afternoon were occupied in the adjusting of bracing and other wires, the fitting of a new air-control, and attending to various other details, but the large crowd - “no charge made” - waited until six o’clock when the aviator made his first flight.

 With the engine pulling beautifully, the plane rose to about 1000 feet and, at a high speed, Mr Pickles carried out a three mile flight, landing in good style. The aviator expressed himself satisfied with the efficiency of the new machine, and everything pointed to a successful demonstration tomorrow..” 

The Cheltenham Chronicle wrote on the 29th March 1913: 

“..The weather on Easter Monday was ideal and there was a very full days flying – three or four flights in the morning, three in the afternoon and two after tea. The crowd inside the field was a good one, but those who paid were greatly outnumbered by those who preferred a free view from the road. In the morning Mr Pickles made a flight over Gloucester, and also one over Cheltenham, the latter with his manager (Mr Ding) as passenger. Mr Pickles decided not to take any of the public as passengers that day, as the machine required a little adjustment for the extra weight in order to avoid all risk. In the afternoon there was a ‘figure eight’ flight, an exhibition of “bomb” throwing and an altitude flight. For the last named it was announced that he would endeavour to reach a height of 6,000 feet. When he came down after a long stay aloft he was able to say that he had reached 7,500 feet, thus gaining the altitude record for the Midlands. Mr B. C. Hucks, who visited Cheltenham and Gloucester recently, previously held the record with 7,000 feet. After tea Mr Pickles made two more flights and on the second occasion he took Mr Whitehouse, a Hendon aviator, for a trip all over the city. By this time the west was all aglow with the sunset, with the shadows creeping over, and as the bird-machine glided away westward it presented a very pretty and romantic spectacle against the reddened sky..” 

 The Pickles tour visited a few locations eventually reaching Newcastle-under-lyme where in late April they arrive at the same time as the King’s visit and decide to fly over the royal procession. 

This encounter with royalty was written about in The Aeroplane magazine: 

“..On Tuesday (22nd), the King was to visit the potteries, arriving from Crewe by by motor. Mr Pickles looked up his route and went to meet him, finding him passing through a village about four miles out. The aeroplane then became part of the royal procession, only it had to keep circling round in order to keep back. When he saw a really decent field he would swoop down to about 30 feet, rush along past the royal car and jump the trees at the farther end..” 

 Ding wrote in The Aeroplane magazine about the young Australian pilot Pickles: 

“..I may say that if Pickles was flying at Hendon he would create quite a stir. His flying reminds me of Hamel, and he seems to have got quite at home at it in a short time. As to the machine itself, I think it is the most amazing ‘bus I have seen as yet. It’s flying speed is not great – about the same as a 50 h.p. Gnome-Bleriot – but it climbs very fast, even with a passenger, and lands about as slow as any machine in existance. I have seen Pickles practically stop before touching the ground and land without the sign of a pancake, even in a calm. Such a ‘bus as this is ideal for exhibition work, as it makes quite small fields into safe landing grounds. 

 The 60 h.p. Anzani has given no trouble whatever up till now and needs no more attention than an ordinary reliable car engine. Pickles has been running it on Pratts Perfection spirit and lubricating it with any old oil he could pick up in the neighbourhood suitable for cars. He finds that carbonisation is practically extinct when using any decent mineral oil and, except from a cleanliness point of view, he prefers it to castor oil. 

 This exhibition work is really a sort of charity organisation as about 85 percent of the crowd invariably view the flying from outside! However, it is probably doing no end of good for the progress of aviation, and one gets plenty of sport out of it and can generally manage to pay expenses..” 

 Ding appears to have taken a short break before managing another tour in the summer with Ronald Whitehouse. 

As reported in the Lincolnshire Echo on 20th June 1913: 

“..We hear that the exhibitions Mr Whitehouse gives are marvelous and very interesting, and include the following events:- bomb dropping, trick flying, high flying, passenger carrying and flying in the dusk guided by rockets and flares. This event, which is quite original with Mr Whitehouse, will interest and thrill everyone on the flying ground. When night has almost fallen he climbs into his monoplane and flies off in the gathering darkness and disappears. He generally makes for some neighbouring town, which he flies around for his own amusement. Those managing the affairs on the flying ground then proceed to light large petrol flares and to send up exceptionally bright signal rockets, and by their aid he is guided back to the ground, alighting amidst the cheers of the spectators. 

 Last week Mr Whitehouse was flying at Sutton near Mansfield and Mr Rowland Ding, his manager, asked him if he would carry out this dusk flight, and off Mr Whitehouse went. However to everyones great disappointment he had not re-appeared in twenty-five minutes, and great anxiety was felt as to his safety. Rocket after rocket was sent up in order to show him the way home, and in half an hour the whirr of his engine was heard high up in the sky, and in about thirty-five minutes he landed safely on the ground, having made a tour of three neighbouring towns..”

Around this time some adverts were published for Ding Model Monoplanes based in Birmingham but haven’t been able to find out if this is where he ever based himself. It may simply have been a commercial deal to use the Ding-Sayers designs.  

“..Ding Quality Model Monoplanes, fly in any wind. The patent fin ensures stability. Price 30s. Write for Booklet and also list of the successful high-efficiency Chauviere INTEGRAL Model Propellers – The W. R. Ding Company 24-32 Villa Road, Handsworth, Birmingham..”  

These Ding Quality Models were written about in The Aeroplane magazine: 

“.. The Ding model aeroplane has been well known to most people interested in aeronautical work since 1909, chiefly on account of it’s wonderful stability in high winds and also on account of it’s successes in practically every model competition held in 1910 and 1911. During these years it was known as the Ding-Sayers monoplane. The new makers, trading under the name of the W. R. Ding Company of Handsworth, Birmingham, have very much improved the machine without altering the general design. It is now lighter and stronger than formerly, flies much farther and is an extremely practical job in the the whole model takes to pieces, every part being detachable by means of the minature nuts and bolts, eyebolts and wire strainers which are used.

 The general method of consruction is that using a main spar of hard drawn steel tube, strutting and staying it by means of steel king-posts and steel wire, a method introduced into model aeroplane engineering by the old Ding-Sayers machine and used on several present-day models. However, the method has been further improved by the way in which the king-posts are held in position by means of very small aluminium tubes so arranged that by slacking off a stray wire and unscrewing a small brass cap, the whole king-post slips out of the spar. All the sockets and sleeves on the model are made of hard brass,  hard soldered, plated and laquered.

 The makers in their catalogue list and price every part of the model separately so that anything that gets damaged can easily be replaced.

 The method of constructing the planes is the same as that used on the old Ding-Sayers machines. Special mention should be made of the propellers, which are designed by the W.R. Ding company and manufactured by M. Chauviere..”

 Over the preceding few months a project had been taking shape in the background. Ding’s old schoolfriend from the Finsbury Technical College, Fredrick Handley Page, was now an acomplished aircraft designer and manufacturer and had been working on a new Biplane design in his workshop at Hendon which was nearing completion. Ronald Whitehouse test flew this new design some time in early November of 1913. By late November Rowland Ding and his friend Thomas Lindsay Bainbridge took another series of test flights as passengers over a week with a view to buying it in connection with a business venture they were working on which was to be known as ‘The Northern Aircraft Company.’ 

 Thomas Bainbridge was a member of the Bainbridge family who owned a large department store in Newcastle (later Bainbridges would become Selfridges but people locally still used the Bainbridge’s name.) Rather than being content with this comfortable life Thomas was always keen to find adventure especially outdoors being an accomplished shooter, motorbike rider and eventually joining the military. It’s not known how he and Rowland first met but Bainbridge, like Rowland Ding, was also a qualified Electrical Engineer and interested in flight. A tentitive plan is formed to establish The Northern Aircraft Company, with Thomas Bainbridge as the legal owner of the Handley Page biplane. It has been suggested that they are already thinking about the flying school they would later take over in the Lake District as Rowland Ding asks Handley Page at this early stage about landing gear suitable for use on water.    

On one of these early test flights of the Handley Page biplane Ronald Whitehouse flew into a partridge, decapitating it, one of the first such incidents ever recorded, the group later ate the bird as described in contemporary reports:

“.. One fatality did occur during the afternoon when Mr Whitehouse, flying in the Handley Page biplane, collided with a fellow aviator in the person of a partridge. The unfortunate ornithopter was decapitated by the propellor and was afterwards caught by a wire with the result that he was canabalistically devoured the same evening by the other aviators..”

 The loop was achieved towards the end of that year. It was first performed in England by Frenchman Peugoud at Brooklands and then by Hucks at Hendon. Hucks had travelled to France to learn how to perform it. The plane was adapted to hold him in with extra thick leather straps and the loop was performed at such a leisurely pace that those straps were absolutely necessary to stop him from falling out. He was watched by Sidney Pickles with his leg in plaster, the victim of an accident which was described in Flight Magazine in September: 

“..A final series of spirals were made over the paddock, the first of these being at about 100 ft up; a second spiral was made and then a third; which terminated in a sudden dive from about 60 ft to the ground, just behing the megaphone box. Fortunately there were few people on the spot where the aeroplane struck, although but a short time before many people and cars were in the exact spot..”  

Around this time there appears to have been one last push for sales of Ding Model Monoplanes with adverts pitching them as a high quality toy for Christmas 1913 and listing top department stores as stockists: 

“..DING QUALITY MONOPLANES are stocked in London by Gamages, Holborn; Hamleys, Regent Street; Selfridges, Oxford Street. They are well worth inspection – The W.R. Ding company 24 Villa Road Handsworth, Birmingham..” 

 By January of 1914 B. C. Hucks had performed his 100th loop. What had seemed almost impossible a few months earlier was now becoming a routine part of his aerial shows. Once people heard about the loops they started to turn up in even larger numbers and many chose not to pay to see the show hanging around nearby vantage points instead. In Moortown, Leeds there was a passionate speech from Hucks to the crowd on the subject of the meanness of these freeloaders some of whom had “turned up in motor cars!” When this was reported in the local papers some people wrote to Hucks apologising and in some cases even enclosing payment. 

 In Febuary the Northern Aircraft Company was officially formed. Directors were the Lord Brothers (Arthur and Reginald - motor car dealers), Thomas Lindsay Bainbridge and William Rowland Ding. The Northern Aircraft Company needed a pilot for their Handley Page biplane so Rowland Ding is signed with the Beaty flying school, based at Hendon, for a £75 course of lessons (adjusted for inflation it would be something like £8,000 or £9,000 in 2020 money.)   

 The Beaty school was run by an American called George Beaty who had been a student of the the Wright brothers. His adverts described it as ‘SOME SCHOOL’ and said you could learn quickly and in comfort. For two weeks in late April Rowland Ding was a pupil at the Beaty school qualifying with “just 3 hours tuition.” It’s very possible he’d had earlier practice given the loose nature of licensing a few years earlier and he certainly had considerable exposure to flying by now but Beaty didn’t waste a moment to feature this incredible success in several of his adverts. 

“..THE BEATTY SCHOOL OF FLYING – Mr W. Rowland Ding took his pilots certificate after 3 ½ hours in the air, 14 days actual training. During his test flights he reached an altitude of 1,150 feet, gliding down from this height with his engine cut off.

 The Beatty method of training is the quickest and most thorough.
 
 Tuition on Handley Page monoplanes and Wright Biplanes - £75. 

The Beatty School of Flying, London Aerodrome, Hendon, N. W..” 

 Two days after he qualified as a pilot Rowland Ding took delivery of the Handley Page biplane. He’d had several trips in it over the last month as a passenger to test some last minute adjustments but this was the first time solo at the controls. He makes a short flight to Ealing and back and is thrilled with how the plane performs. A few days later he repeats this trip but lands awkwardly and breaks the landing gear as reported in The Aeroplane magazine: 

“..On Wednesday, Mr Rowland Ding, having taken over the Handley Page biplane, 100 h.p. Anzani engine, made a good cross-country flight for his first time on the machine over Ealing way. On Saturday, after another cross country trip he landed at his own angle instead of the machines, in avoiding a cow, and deteriorated the chassis and propeller..”  

The landing gear is replaced and a silencer is fitted. Handley Page has lined up a job for Ding – a cross-channel passenger flight from Hendon to take Princess Ludwig von Lowenstein-Wertheim, a famous society sportswoman, to France for a social engagement.  This appears to have benefitted Handley Page financially and been excellent publicity for Ding. 

 As described in the book ‘British Aviation – The Pioneer Years’ by Harold Penrose:

“..Handley Page had at last found a source of finance to build an Atlantic contender for the Daily Mail prize through arranging a taxi flight for Princess Ludwig von Lowenstein-Wertheim in the H.P. Biplane. Piloted by Rowland Ding a director of the Northern Aircraft Co., the new owners of the machine, the princess who had an urgent social engagements in Paris, duly set off from Hendon at seven-thirty on May 21st, despite the English haze and Channel fog. 

 Impossible visibility forced them to land at Eastbourne and wait, so the machine was eventually able to reach Calais by 4:30 p.m. Although no time had been saved, the princess was so delighted with the experience she told Frederick Handley Page she intended to fly the Atlantic, and asked him to build a machine. With his usual adroit business caution H. P. managed to extract a post-dated cheque for £1000, which he explained would give assurance to purchase materials and commence work at once.

 His later colleague, G. V. Lachmann, describing the occasion, said: “On the all-important day H.P. cashed the cheque as soon as the bank opened. An hour later the princess telephoned to stop payment - but it was too late” Design then started on 60ft two seater tractor biplane, the ‘L’ 200 – a scaled up and aerodynamically cleaner version of the H.P. Type ‘G’ in which the princess had flown to france, and a Canon-Unne Salmson of 200 h.p. was selected as the power plant..”  

 After returning to Hendon he flies to Bath, getting lost twice.The Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette reported: 

“..Mr W. Rowland Ding, whose flying machine, a biplane, was seen passing over Bath on Tuesday afternoon was interviewed in the hangar at Lansdown by a “Chronicle” representative on Wednesday. He is a young man of charming personality, and although he confesses to 28 years of age, he hardly looks quite so old. He was educated at Canterbury and London University, and although he obtained his pilot’s certificate as recently as April 27th, he has already had an experience such as many older aviators would envy. 

 Bath people will have had their interest heightened by the fact that Mr Ding’s mother is the sister of Mr T. Pagan Lowe, physician and surgeon. Mr Ding himself must be fairly well known in Bath, where he has often made a stay, sometimes for months together. That was one of the reasons why he decided on Tuesday to fly from Hendon to Bath, a journey which he no doubt hoped to accomplish in record time. 

 Unfortunately however the needle of his compass played him false, for some reason or other it did not point due north and instead of getting to Bath direct he found himself crossing the Solent to effect a landing on the Isle of Wight. Again he made a fresh cast for Bath, and in about 25 minutes he was over Salisbury Plain and alighting near the cathedral city. Then he rose once more and in about 22 minutes he came to grass on Lansdown. He was unable to tell our representative the exact mileage he had covered; but the journey from Hendon to the Isle of Wight took three-quarters of an hour; from the island to Salisbury 25 minutes; and from Salisbury to Bath, about 28 miles, occupied just 22 minutes. Mr Ding says that owing to the gusts from the hills and the wind pockets between the Plain and Bath he had a very rough passage without a paralell in his experience

 The machine Mr Ding steers is a Handley-Page biplane fitted with a 110 h.p. Anzani engine. The machine is of a type which is so stable that it is claimed to have the power of automatically righting itself.

 Mr Ding, who is nephew of Mr Pagan Lowe, of Bath, is going about the country in the interests of a Newcastle firm, the Northern Aircraft Company (Ltd) of which he is a director, his object being to popularise the type of machine he is using. The machine posesses some remarkable qualities. While it will fly at 80 miles it can also be reduced to a speed of 30 miles an hour, a fact which enables the pilot to bring it very slowly to earth, and also to get up again out of a small ground. It’s construction combines the finest qualities of a monoplane, with the stronger and more stable principles of the biplane. The pilot does not need any assistance in starting the engine. He can set it in motion, and leave the engine running, as is done with an ordinary motor-car, and then, after walking round, he can mount to his seat at leisure and start off at full speed.

 The normal weight of the machine and pilot is 1,600lb but on Tuesday last week the total weight was increased to 2,200lb, when Mr Ding had the unique experience of carrying a European princess and her luggage across the channel. Princess Ludwig of Lowenstein-Wertheim was at Hendon, and wished to get to Calais very expeditiously. Mr Ding undertook to convey her. The princess, it may be said, was the first royalty to make the cross-Channel flight. She took hre seat in the machine, wrapped in expensive furs; her portmanteau and other luggage were stowed aboard, and Mr Ding set off with his precious charge. Passing over Eastbourne, he foresaw a possibility of engine trouble, and in order to avoid the semblance of a risk he came down at the Aerodrome and had a look round. Then he took his passenger several hundred yards out from the shore, and coasted along as far as Folkestone before striking out in a diagonal line for Calais about 34 miles distant.

When it is added that Calais was reached in 15 minutes after leaving Folkestone it will be seen that an average speed of some 135 miles an hour must have been maintained. The pace was indeed terrific, as Mr Ding admits; but the machine will fly under ordinary circumstances nearly 80 miles an hour, and there was a strong wind behind it. The Princess was delighted with her experience, and was quickly on her was to Paris. 

 Mr Ding has now completed the arrangements for his Whitsuntide flying program in Bath [..] he has taken a suitable field near the Beckford monument on Lansdown, and here, on Whit-Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, he will give passenger flights, altitude flights, and exhibitions of trick flying from 4 pm until dusk each day. It is worth noting that passenger flights will be arranged for on the ground. There will be a band in attendance and popular prices will be charged for admission..” 

 Handley Page, like George Beatty, also chose to capitaise on his relationship with Ding and ran an advert:

“..HANDLEY PAGE AEROPLANES – The ease with which HANDLEY PAGE aeroplanes may be controlled is evidenced by the record of the past week.

April 28th – Mr W. Rowland Ding takes his pilot’s certificate. 
May 21st – 100 h.p. Handley Page biplane, piloted by Mr Rowland Ding, flies to Calais via Eastbourne and returns to Hendon. 
May 26th – 100 h.p. Handley Page biplane, piloted by Mr Rowland Ding, files from Hendon to Bath. 

HANDLEY PAGE LTD. Contractors to the War Office. 72 Victoria Street, S.W...” 

 Ding enters the Aerial Derby race at the end of May with a prize of £400 but it’s delayed due to bad weather so he decides to fly to Bath to promote The Northern Aircraft Company with some flights at Lansdown near the racecourse. 

  Exhibition flying was one part of the early air shows and another key component was passenger carrying where, for a fee, you could have a short flight around the local area. Some passenger carrying by Rowland Ding was described in the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette published 6th June 1914: 

“..Mr Ding intimated that he was ready to carry passengers and the first to make the flight was Miss Ivy Ashman, a well known local soprano. She donned the close-fitting cap and goggles which are such a well known feature of the aviators equipment and climbed into the passengers seat. Amid the friendly cheers and salutations of the spectators the biplane started with it’s double burden. Mr Ding flew in the direction of Swainswick, and executed and amusing manoevure by dipping suddenly and disappearing from view. One of the stewards in the centre of the enclosure ran hastily forward, warning the spectators to stand back, but a moment later the biplane had risen again, and Mr Ding and his passenger alighted to renewed cheers. It was understood that £3 3s was the price paid for this experience..”

At some point during the trip to Bath he takes his wife up as a passenger on her first flight. On one of these flights he does some damage to his propeller and has to wait at Lansdown for repairs. He cannot compete in the Aerial Derby – a good idea as weather again disrupts the race. 

During the time at Lansdown waiting for repairs he is interviewed in the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette, this is published on 13th June:

“..Mr Ding was asked about his plans for the immediate future,  and he replied that he intended to fly to Harrogate as soon as his new propeller arrived. From Harrogate he expects to go to Hull where he proposes to fly during the visit of the King and Queen in a fortnight hence. 

 Mr Ding, it is interesting to record, has a permanent “flying ground” at Hull and is getting options on other grounds in all parts of the country. These grounds will be always available for the exclusive use of Mr Ding and those associated with him. “The Corporation of Harrogate have given us permission to erect our hangar on the Stray” remarked Mr Ding as showing the interest which the municipal authority in Bath’s rival spa are taking in his movements..”  

After leaving Bath he flies to Harrogate to promote Northern Aircraft Company. He writes to Flight magazine and describes this journey: 

“..The most terrifying experience I have had since I have been flying, and really the most marvellous that any aviator could well have, occurred to me when flying from Bath to Harrogate. Setting out from Bath very early one morning, about five o’clock and intending to fly straight through to Harrogate without a stop, I found the conditions practically perfect, with the sky beautifully clear, and not a cloud to be seen. Before very many miles had been covered, however in the distance I saw a little fleecy cloud just making it’s appearance. It looked quite thin and very innocent indeed, and I thought the best way would be to get over the top of the cloud and continue on my way by the aid of the compass. Having risen over the top of what appeared to be the little cloud, I found that it got larger and larger, the ground being quite hidden from sight; there was simply a beautiful level sea of fleecy white clouds underneath me. I felt quite happy, because the compass appeared to be doing it’s work, the machine was going well, and the engine running beautifully. 

 Then the sea of white cloud began to rise gradually, when I naturally pulled up the nose of the aeroplane a little and climbed up what looked like the side of a big snowy mountain. After keeping on for some time, getting higher and higher, one of the plugs in the engine, probably owing to becoming fouled with oil, mis-fired. 

 Thus having one cylinder cut off, the machine could not climb quite so rapidly, and as the surface of the cloud itself seemed suddenly to take a very steep ascent, this meant that I had either to come down below it or else continue straight through the cloud. The extent of the latter being an unknown quantity, I thought the best thing would be to dive down until I was underneath it. Switching the engine off, I started diving down from a height of between 3,000 and 4,000 ft., the cloud getting thicker until I could not even see the aeroplane itself. In fact, I could only just distinguish the instruments in front of me, about 2 ft. from my face. 

 Of course I was watching the height recorder very intently and very anxiously, because it was a great surprise to find that the cloud was so deep. I thought I should soon be underneath it and have a clear view of the ground from about 2,000 or 3,000 ft. I went on diving for a long time, until my horror the height recorder registered nothing, which meant I must be very near the ground. 
 As I was unable to see anything at all, I thought the best thing to do would be to make the machine fly as slowly as ever it could. I knew sooner or later I should have to hit something, and so the best thing was to hit it very slowly instead of very fast. 

 Fortunately the engine I have – the Anzani – throttles down beautifully, and I managed to slow it down til the aeroplane was only travelling  at about 35 miles and hour, and with teeth set I continued at this pace until suddenly – we hit the ground. Under such conditions a perfect landing could hardly be expected, and it is something to record that there was very little damage done to the aeroplane itself – in fact it was flying again in two days time. When the fog cleared, giving me an opportunity to take my bearings, I found that I had landed in a barley field, about a mile and a half outside Stroud in Gloucestershire, and the most wonderful part was, that it was the only field for many miles around on which a landing was possible. All round were thick forests and very high hills. I had motored to Stroud a good many times previously, and scoured the whole district round to look for a suitable ground on which to give exhibition flying but there was never a one to be found, and ultimately I had to give it up as a hopeless job. However, from above it will be seen that my Handley-Page biplane was more successful and found a ground of it’s own accord. I may congratulate myself, therefore, upon the very lucky ending to what might easily have been a much more serious, not to say tragic, affair..” 

In Harrogate he bases himself in a tent on the Stray and does passenger carrying for several weeks (‘five guinnea flights’) occasionally visiting other towns. Robert Blackburn also has a tent on The Stray at this time. Ding takes some aerial photographs, including a view of the Northern Aircraft Company and Blackburn tents on The Stray. Ding describes his technique of shutting off the engine while taking the exposure to make sure the photograph is completely free of distortion due to vibrations. He submits photographs and a details of his technique to magazines and mentions that his co-director in the Northern Aircraft Company, Reginald Lord  is taking an active role in the running of the company and has arranged flying lessons at the Beaty school for himself. 	

 While Ding is based in Harrogate the Leeds Mercury mention him in an article about flying from the Stray: 

“..The interpretaion of the new regulations adopted by the Harrogate Corporation with regard to Sunday flying is causing keen discussion. 

 The local authority, it will be remembered, first prohibited Sunday flying, but after the opposition which broke out, and in one case took the form of smashing windows at the protestors shop, they ammended this to the extent that machines would be allowed to arrive and depart, provided they did so out of church hours. 

 About three o’clock on Sunday afternoon Mr Rowland Ding in his Handley-Page biplane flew from the Stray with a passenger to Darlington, and arrived back soon after nine o’clock. Lights were shown to guide him back to the landing place, and hundreds of people assembled to witness his return..” 

In June of 1914 he makes some flights from Holray Park about 6 miles west of Goole. In late July he makes a longer trip to Newcastle staying for around a week. 

 Adverts for this trip read:

“..COME AND SEE THE FLYING at GOSFORTH PARK TO-DAY (Saturday, July 25th) from 4:30 until dusk. 

WEATHER PERMITTING. 

The well known Hendon Airman Mr. W. Rowland Ding will give exhibitions of TRICK FLYING, including Bomb Dropping, High Flying, Fast and Slow Flying, Flying in the Dusk Guided by Flares, and Passenger Carrying..” 

As reported in the Newcastle Journal – Saturday 25th July 1914: 

“..The aviator Mr W. Rowland Ding who holds the record for the cross-Channel flight, which he accomplished in 15 minutes with Princess Ludwig of Lowenstein-Wertheim, who he brought as a passenger from Hendon, will give an exhibition today at Gosforth Park. Mr Ding flew from Harrogate to Newcastle last Tuesday, accomplishing the journey of 81 miles in 1 hour 5 minutes flying time, bringing a passenger from Harrogate to Darlington, and taking another passenger from Darlington to Newcastle.  

 The exhibition will include a demonstration of bomb dropping, high flying, fast and slow flying, flying when it is too dark for the aviator to see the ground, guided by petrol flares etc. The machine is specially adapted for passenger carrying, and is considered among authorities to be one of the finest passenger-carrying machines existing. Passenger flights may be booked either at the offices of the Northern Aircraft Company. Ltd. Saville House, Saville Row, or on the ground during the exhibition. 

 During the last month Mr Ding carried 78 passengers at Harrogate, while during the last 2 ½ months he has carried over 200. The machine is a Handley Page biplane fitted with 110 h.p. Anzani engine. It’s flying speed is 80 miles an hour but it can be reduced to as low a speed as 30 miles an hour. 

 The exhibition will be subject to the weather being suitable, but the public should know that whatever the wind is during the daytime, it nearly always calms down in the evening, so that spectators on the ground are almost certain to see a good exhibition of flying.

 Recently Mr Ding was flying in a wind of 78 miles an hour at Harrogate. Last Saturday Mr Ding gained a height  of 8,000 feet  at Harrogate, and with the exception of two days he has flown every day for the last month..” 

Leaving Newcastle with his wife and daughter at dusk to fly to Northallerton to do some flights at the carnival he unfortunately gets lost and has to make an unplanned landing in the dark.  

As reported in The Aeroplane magazine: 

“..Last Tuesday evening Mr W. Rowland Ding left Gosforth Park for Northallerton, carrying Mrs and Miss Ding as passengers. Owing to darkness he was compelled to land at Willington Co. Durham and complete the journey the next morning..” 

 While doing a short passenger flight in Northallerton as part the seventh annual Northallerton Carnival he crashes quite badly after hitting some barbed wire on top of a fence causing significant damage to the plane. Fortunately both he and the passenger, Mr Lewis Prest, are unharmed. 

The Aeroplane magazine reports: 

“..Flying at Northallerton Carnival on Thursday, Mr Ding, owing to engine failure while making a passenger flight, was compelled to land hurridly and turned the machine head over heels owing to fouling some obstrucion with the chassis. The machine was badly damaged but Mr Ding and his passenger emerged unharmed..”

In the Newcastle Journal 31st July 1914: 

“..At the seventh carnival at Northallerton, yesterday, a great attraction was an exhibition of flying. Mr Rowland Ding of Newcastle who flew from Willington near Durham, and alighted safely in the show field. He made a flight from the field, taking with him Mr Lewis Prest as passenger, and again flew finely. As he came to the ground Mr Ding’s biplane caught some barbed wire in the top of a thorn fence and turned a somersault. 
 
 Fortunately, the occupants were not hurt, although the propeller on the biplane was smashed clean off and it’s runners damaged, whilst serious injury was done to it’s engine, rendering any more ascents impossible..” 

 The aftermath of this crash is captured by several local phtotographers and postcards were produced showing the damaged Handley Page biplane nose down in the field, surrounded by spectators,  Rowland Ding sends one of these postcards to his wife and writes on it: 

“..It’s a good thing that this didn’t happen when you were in it! – Love from Rowley..” 

The damage to the plane is bad enough that it needs to be sent by railway to Handley Page at Hendon for repair. Unfortunately while it is away the First World War breaks out and the plane is requisitioned along with other items at the aerodrome to help in the war effort.        

 In November of 1914 the Northern Aircraft Company officially took over the Lakes Flying School in Windermere, the next part of their business plan. Along with the school they get several planes of different designs in various states of repair. The Lakes Flying School had benefited extensively from the engineering of an enigmatic Greek inventor called Oscar Gnospellius – he had designed, constructed and flown several different planes which was complicated by his suffering greatly from sciatica. The Gnospellius hydro-monoplane had been the first plane to take off from water in England in early 1912. The wide expanses of water plus the seaplanes with large floats were ideal for beginners to learn on the lake in relative safety. 

The first adverts for the Northern Aircraft Company Flying School read:

“..THE NORTHERN AIRCRAFT CO., LIMITED HEREBY GIVE NOTICE THAT, having taken over the whole PROPERTY, including HANGARS, etc., of the LAKES FLYING COMPANY, Windermere, they are opening the BEST EQUIPPED AND BEST ORGANISED FLYING SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY. 

The school equipment consists of “Tractor” Monoplanes and Biplanes and “Pusher” Monoplanes and Biplanes and attached to the staff are 3 competent Aviators including MR. W. ROWLAND DING. The flying area  is the LARGEST IN GREAT BRITAIN and it is possible to obtain an 8-mile straight flight without obstruction, while circuits 1 ½ miles in diameter can be made, always over the specified flying area, and always over WATER.

Pupils at this school will therefore have the following advantages:- (1) The best instruction. (2) The most varied experience on ALL types of machines. (3) NO WAITING for machines to be repaired – plenty in reserve. (4) The greatest security from accident. 

This is infact an ideal school run under ideal conditions at an ideal spot, where living is cheap, where there is sport in abundance (attached to the school are motorboats, hydroplanes etc.), and where a pupil learns to FLY and not only to obtain his Pilot’s certificate. 

Special terms for EXTRA PRACTICE on WATERPLANES to those who have already learned to fly land machines. 

An excellent school for those wishing to join the Naval and Military Air Service...” 

The Aeroplane magazine wrote about the Northern Aircraft Company and their acquisition of the Lakes Flying Company: 

“..Notification has been received that the Northern Aircraft Company, Limited of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, is taking over the whole property of the Lakes Flying Company at Windermere, and is opening a really well equiped waterplane school at once, under the management of Mr. Rowland Ding. In addition, the firm is starting, on a large scale, to build land machines in their own works at Bowness-on-Windermere, where a competent staff which has already been engaged is being rapidly increased for this work.

 The waterplane school will start with an equipment of four machines; two monoplanes and two biplanes. The joint managing directors of the concern; Messrs. Arthur and Reginald Lord, and their general manager, Mr Ding, are to be congratulated on their enterprise in starting this new activity, for a waterplane school on Windermere should provide very useful preliminary training for seaplane pilots. 

 Pupils taking their certificates there on waterplanes would quickly pick up the handling of land machines if required to do so, and it might be possible for the Admiralty to support the school, either by sending probationary flight lieutenants there for their preliminary training, or even by allowing junior officers who have already taken their certificates on land machines to acquire experience of water flying at this school. Instead of sending them straight away to one of the Naval Air Stations they might be sent to Windermere, where their opportunities for practice would probably be much more frequent, owing to the fact that it’s generally possible to practice on the comparatively calm water of Windermere when at the same time there is quite an awkward sea running at the coast..” 

Flight magazine reported on the takeover of the Lakes Flying school:

“..Although comparitively little has been heard with regard to the activities of the school and works of the Lakes Flying Co., on Lake Windermere, a good deal of construction and school work has been done, resulting in the production of several school machines and a number of pilots, some of whom have turned out to be really fine flyers. Under the management and direction of Mr E. W. Wakefield, who has until quite recently been the director and owner of the Lakes Flying Co., a machine of original design has been evolved and given excellent results, which does it’s designer, Mr Gnospellius, as well as it’s constructors, The Lakes Flying Co., credit. 

 Arrangements have now been considered for the Northern Aircraft Company, Ltd., whose director and manager, Mr W. Rowland Ding, is well known as a successful pilot of the Handley Page biplane, to take over the whole business of the Lakes Flying Co., including the hangars, machines, plant &c. 

 The present equipment of the school comprises three machines, whilst the construction of new machines will be commened at once. As Mr W. Rowland Ding, in addition to being an experienced pilot, is also a capable designer, the appearance of the new machines will be awaited with interest.
 It seems likely that the new school will quicky become popular, for Lake Windermere is a very attractive flying venue, owing to it’s elongated shape, a “straight” of eight miles in length and an average width of about three-quaters of a mile, increasing in places to slightly over a mile. 

 As most of the tuition work will take place over the lake, the danger of serious accident should be remote, especially as a motor boat of 12 h.p. is always in attendance upon the waterplanes. Apart from the waterplanes it is intended to build several land-going machines, so that pupils will have an opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the handling of both types. Attached to the school is a very fine hydroplane, fitted with a 50 h.p water cooled Clerget engine. This boat has a speed of about 50 m.p.h., and will carry four passengers. It will be at the disposal of the pupils, and should form one more attraction to the, in this respect, already well provided school..” 

Ding described his arrival at Windermere and early experiments with water planes to Flight magazine: 

“..On arriving at Windermere I found that there were three machines: 1. The ‘Water Hen’ the Farman type biplane with front elevator, built by the Lakes Flying Co,. [...] 2. A 50 h.p. Gnome-Avro biplane. 3. A very interesting 80 h.p. ‘pusher’ monoplane designed by Mr Gnospellius and built by the Lakes Flying Co., this machine being not quite finished. I decided at once that the third machine was the one which would probably put up the best performances, and I therefore packed the others in different hangars out of the way and set to to finish it off. As soon as finished I had this machine placed on it’s bogey and run down into the lake, and after a short preliminary run of the engine, which behaved splendidly, I set off on my first waterplane trip.

 I may say that I have never seen a waterplane in the air, and only know what it looks like from photographs. It was with some fear and trepidation that I opened the engine out and waited to see what would happen. One or two seconds after I started I found that I had not the throttle adjusted quite right and therefore began to adjust it to get more power out of the engine. So busy was I doing this that I did not notice that I had left the water and got some 20 feet in the air, and when I found out what had happened I felt very relieved indeed, as I had been told that the first thing that I would do would be to get the front of the float under water and turn a somersault!
 
 The machine felt so nice in the air that I took it straight up to about 600 or 700 ft., and managed to do quite small circuits. I found out, however, that the side areas were all wrong, and the machine had a great tendancy to spin [...] I therefore had a large fin made and fitted to the rear of the machine, and, on trying it again, I found that this was a wonderful improvement, as the machine now seems nice to handle in the air, although somewhat slow, as any I have tried, and there is no tendancy to spin at all. The third flight I made with a passenger of about 12 ½ stone and this flight was quite successful. The machine lifts a passenger quite well and will do as small circuits as any machine I have seen. I find landing on the water as easy as landing on terra firma	, except perhaps when the lake is so smooth that it looks like glass but one soon gets used to this too..”    

Further adverts for the school made clear the advantages of studying there:

“..THE NORTHERN AIRCRAFT COMPANY LIMITED

 By December Ding is teaching every day at the flying school which is gaining popularity. Rather than simply say that the school is the best, adverts are now run that aim to incite some friendly rivallry with the Beatty school playing on their “this is SOME SCHOOL” adverts: 

“..THE NORTHERN AIRCRAFT COMPANY, LTD. THE SEAPLANE SCHOOL. 

This is more than ‘some’ school; it is a college of aeronautics. 

You can learn the ABC of flying or you can go on to the other letters. No one has got to XYZ yet but we take you the nearest.

We teach you to fly biplanes, or monoplanes, tractor or pusher. Mr Rowland Ding, assisted by other pilots, will give you personal tuition in each. 

We provide real technical instruction on engines, aerodynamics and aquadynamics. 

We do it all expiditiously, efficiently, and with the maximum of safety. 

Incidentially we posess one of the finest flying grounds in the world. 

Come and see for yourself – fares returned to pupils. 

NORTHERN AIRCRAFT CO., LTD. BOWNESS-ON-WINDERMERE..”  

Prompted by this Beatty decides to run another type of advert.. “CAN THE PUPIL TEACH THE MASTER?” it reads in bold letters. It seems friendly enough but Beaty was certainly by now feeling the squeeze from increasing numbers of flying schools opening. 

“..TWO LATE PUPILS OF THE BEATTY SCHOOL (SOME SCHOOL) - 

Mr W. Rowland Ding Chief Pilot and General Manager of the Northern Aircraft Co,. Ltd. Bowness on Windermere obtained his brevet No. 774 on April 28th 1914 after 3 ½ hours training in the air, fourteen days actual training. 

Mr Felix Ruffy, proprieter of the Ruffy School of Flying, London	Aerodrome, Hendon obtained his Brevet No. 888 on August 19th 1914 after 6 hours in the air. 

CAN THE PUPIL TEACH THE MASTER? 

Staff of instructors: 

George Beatty, fifth year of training experience. 
Edouard Baumann, fourth year of training experience. 
Gino Virgillo, trained personally by Mr Beatty. 

THE BEATTY SCHOOL OF FLYING, LONDON AERODROME, HENDON, N.W...”

 The Northern Aircraft company seemed to enjoy this friendly rivalry with the Beatty school and ran an advert addressing Beatty:

“..Can the pupil teach the master? YES! THANK GOODNESS! That is the fundamental law of human development, otherwise we would still be wearing fig leaves!

 We teach you so that you may one day teach us. We do not push you half-fledged, to fly for your ticket as they do at some schools…” 

 From the start of January the repaired Handley Page biplane is flown by RNAS pilots but they are not experienced with this type of plane and manage to crash it on more than one occasion. 
 
 Ding gives lessons at nighttime in late January, something that hadn’t been done before. His friend Flemming-Williams by now an accomplished commercial artist paints the scene and this image along with details of the school and it’s prospectus are featured in magazines. The Flemming-Williams art style would come to be a signature of the Northern Aircraft Company’s adverts and promotional material. In Febuary he has a flight with Lindsay Bainbridge where Bainbridge indulges in a little revolver practice! 

 By April Thomas Lindsay Bainbridge is getting ready to go and fight in the war. He spends one more week having flying lessons at the school and bids farewell to his friends. He heads to France by ship and arrives on the day of his (???) birthday. His group comes under attack and he spends the night of his birthday lying in a field. I imagine he, like many, viewed what he was doing as both a necessary duty and an adventure – the full horrors of the war hadn’t been revealed yet and many felt  it could be over in a few months. Tragically he is killed just two days later at the second battle of Ypres while carrying a message over ground that is being heavily shelled.

 A letter was read at the Newcastle Weslyan Synod at Durham on the 13th May, an excerpt read:

“..Last night after dark we buried Lieut. Bainbridge and others. It was the most impressive ceremony I have ever attended. It was a beautiful moonlit night as we carried the bodies down the line wrapped in blankets and lying on stretchers. As we passed each entrenched Batallion, the men stood to attention. At about a quarter of a mile from the trenches on a piece of ground where about six other officers lie buried we laid them to rest. The guns were roaring on every side, and the huge fire-balls the Germans threw into the air illuminated the sky. Lieut. Bainbridge was a plucky and good fellow..” 

 Bainbridge leaves his shares in Northern Aircraft Company and the Handley-Page biplane to Ding, as reported in the Berwick Advertiser on the 19th November 1915:

“..Bequest of an aeroplane by the late Lieut. T. L. Bainbridge, 5th Batt. Northumberland Fusiliers, attached to the Northumbrian Signal Company, Royal Engineers of Holmwood, Clayton Road, Newcastle and Eshott Hall, Felton, Northumberland, and electrical engineer in the firm of Messers. Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson, of Wallsend, was killed on April 27th aged 33 years, leaving  estate of the gross value of £32,443 4s 2d, the net personality being £32,016 6. The testator gives his shares in the Northern Aircraft Company and his 100 h.p. aeroplane to W. Rowland Ding, the premesis, No. 4 Perivale Gardens, Ealing, to Harry Jasper Cox; an annuity of £300 to his sister, Mrs Lister; and the residue of his property to his mother..”  

  During this time Ding performs several test flights with a biplane made by Mann and Grimmer – two model makers turned aircraft designers. Mann was the teacher and Grimmer one of his pupils. When Grimmer left school they went into business together selling model airplanes. Eventually they moved onto full sized aircraft. Their full-sized creation was dogged by issues, some mechanical, some bad luck (e.g tyres bursting or other aircraft moving into the landing area requiring a last minute ‘hop’ over) It seems that despite the issues Ding was happy to continue testing for them. 

 In June Ding first test flies a Blackburn built B.E.2c model. These government designed planes were built to a fairly conservative design and designed to be an easy to assemble by a variety of aircraft companies. They eventually became criticised for being too slow to outmaneuver German aircraft such as the Fokker (earning them the nickname ‘Fokker Fodder’) but at this point they were just about ‘good enough.’ 
The Aeroplane magazine wrote about this test flight: 

“..The most notable event of the afternoon was the appearance of Mr. Rowland Ding on a new machine built by the Blackburn company and intended for active service. He took up Mr M. D. Manton, who during his long career as an aviator has rarely occupied the passenger seat in any machine. Mr Ding gave a really remarkable exhibition of flying, and while he modestly gives much of the credit to the machine, there can be no doubt as to the ability he displayed. Mr Manton who may shortly be engaged in testing similar machines, expressed himself as delighted with the behaviour of the machine. Mr Ding afterwards made a fine flight of over an hours duration, reaching a height of somewhere about 10,000 ft..” 

It is thought to be at this time Rowland Ding became aware of a plane that Blackburn had already completed that was considered too unusual to even be bought or requisitioned by the military – the Blackburn Land Sea Monoplane. Although there was a full airframe it would still need an engine to complete.   

 Around this time it seems that Rowland was also conducting testing for other manufacturers as reported by Ding himself in ‘The Olympian’ - the internal magazine of Blackburn Aeroplane Company: 

“..I happened to be flying some machines from a midland town to the East Coast last week, writes Mr Ding, and one one of those flights – the machines being those of a firm (in no way connected with Olympia) whose mechanics are not quite so careful – the engine suddenly stopped through sheer lack of petrol. They will, you know, if the mechanic forgets to fill the tanks!

 Anyway I landed near a somewhat remote country village, a long way, mind you, from any water of any kind – or any other liquid for the matter of that! 

 It was not long before I was surrounded by a crowd of open-mouthed and wondering yokels and some of the questions they asked me are worthy of record. For instance several fine people, all quite independantly asked “Mister, is it a seaplane, or an aeroplane or a bi-a-plane?” By the fifth time I was tired of answering this particular question, so I told them it was a sort of cross between the three. 

 Several expressed surprise at the size of the machine and said that they “never thought they were more’n a yard wide!” You see they had always seen them high up before.

 One old man, with a great show of authority, was telling an admiring crowd “how it worked.” Explaining that the propeller blew wind under the plane and so raised the machine from the ground, when he suddenly noticed that the propeller, in this case, was behind the plane – whereat he subsided! 
 
 The old farmer in whose field I had landed was full of concern for me because the wind died down almost to a flat calm. He said he doubted that I would get away for several days as there wasn’t enough wind to keep me up..” 

 The next month there was a mishap when RNAS pilots crashed the Handley Page Biplane in a way that left it damaged beyond repair. When Ding learned of this he made a deal with Blackburn for the Land Sea Monoplane frame and managed to get his 100 HP Anzani engine back from the wreckage of the Handley Page biplane to power it. The resulting aircraft was assembled at Windemere in late October 1915. The plane was outfitted with dual controls making it ideal for learning in. The Land Sea Monoplane first flew on the 2nd November 1915 and represented a substantial upgrade over the Gnospelius machines they had inherited. 

 By January of 1916 it was clear that the war wasn’t going to end soon and steps were taken to use the flying school for military purposes. Soon the Northern Aitcraft School adverts started featuring the text Contractors to the Admiralty and indeed it appears to have been Naval pilot who managed to flip the land sea monoplane in April of 1916. The plane was completely written off in this accident. 

 Later that year (certainly by August) Rowland Ding appears to have found himself officially in the role of chief test pilot for Blackburn Aircraft company (Leeds and Brough.) Much of the test flying he was doing involved the B.E.2c aircraft that Blackburn were turning out in quantity for the war effort. At Brough seaplanes could be tested and also it’s been suggested some more experimental designs. The majority of the testing appears to have been the B.E.2c planes that, after being completed on Roundhay Road, were taken to the Soldiers Field in Roundhay Park for test flights. These test flights started to attract crowds and Rowland would sometimes put a show on. 

 Starting in August we have reports that Blackburn were making  Rowland Ding a custom monoplane so he could fly between Leeds and Brough. This plane became known as the White Falcon and it’s been suggested it was made, at least in part, from salvaged components that had been scrapped after wartime inspectors deemed them ‘not good enough.’ We know that the engine at least appears to have been salvaged from the Blackburn land-sea monoplane used at Windermere. In Aeronautics magazine February 1917:

“..(Ding), as a matter of fact, is using daily a monoplane, fitted with a 100 h.p. Anzani motor for journeying between Leeds and Brough, and goes up with it in any sort of weather. The machine was built as recently as the latter part of last year. The engine, by the way, was transferred from a Blackburn hydro-monoplane which Mr Ding used for passenger work on Windermere..”  


 During this time Ding was known to take Blackburn employees on short flights as a reward for their production efforts. As reported in Flight magzine later: 

“..Mr Ding had “taken up” at one time or another 50 of these workers, whose interest in their daily work was quickened by the sensation of enjoying a real flight. In fact, it became a whispered secret at the works that a workers name would reach Mr Ding and be included in his list of passengers if he or she gained the notice of the foreman and the approbation of the manager by increased zeal, and the man at the bench and the girl at the lathe – at least the many of them who craved a flight – strove hard to secure the privilege..” 

   Ding flew the White Falcon back and forth between Leeds and Brough almost daily. RAF roundals were added to it’s wings after an incident where he was almost mistaken for an invading German pilot! 

 Flying from the small aerodrome at Soldier’s Field, Roundhay Park was starting to attract large crowds, leading to an accident, as described in The Olympian magazine: 

“..Flying had proceeded for some little time on the evening of the 15th, when the display was brought to a sudden conclusion by an untoward incident. While sailing over the aerodrome in a westerly direction, Mr Ding’s engine suddenly failed. He made an attempt at a quick landing but found the spectators hopelessly in his path. He had to rapidly choose between killing a dozen of these careless people, or risking the sacrifice of himself and his machine. It is extraordinary how careless the public will be of their safety and how long it takes to teach people to have a little thought for the brave pilot. 

 However on this occasion, Mr Ding, with whom thinking is acting, quickly pulled back his “joy stick,” carried his machine upwards and over the tramway wires, and made his forced landing in the field on the other side of the road, striking with the machine’s nose so forcibly that both he and his passenger were thrown out. Needless to say the propeller was splintered, but it is a tribute to the strong character of the Blackburn fuselage that it stood the shock wonderfully well, for only a few of the wooden members suffered fracture. The chassis remained intact, and both wings – while they were completely dislodged – did not suffer the structural damage one might have expected. Beyond a muddy “christening,” a battered exhaust pipe and one or two broken details, the engine escaped serious damage, too, not one cylinder being torn from it’s seating. 

 The passenger escaped with a few bruises and a little shock, but Mr Ding was rather badly bruised about the face and was gashed a little on both legs. Mr Ding’s blood was up – as well as out – on his face, and after hastitly making certain there were no bones broken, he did the very proper thing in telling the crowd what he thought of their thoughtlessness and their want of sportsman-like consideration for his safety. He hits from the shoulders when he begins, and one doubts whether any of the spectators went away without understanding a little more of what is required when flying is going on. 

 We know that part of the difficulty is due to the fact that there is no definite line marked out as the boundary beyond which spectators must not trespass, and we know that the behaviour of the crowd is at times apt to be less intelligent than that of the individual. But If the public want to see pretty flying such as Mr Ding can give them, they must realise their first obligation is to give the airman a clear deck..” 

 The timing of this accident wasn’t ideal. On the 27th April 1917 it was planned that Ding would fly at an event for the presentation of a battle plane to India. The Olympian magazine describes what happened next: 

“..Two smashed wings, damaged engine, cracked fuselage and a broken under-carriage were all put right in an astonishingly short time, and the special hospitality which Mr Ding extended to some of the employees, by inviting them to the theatre the following week, was but an inadequate expression of the gratitude he felt to them for their smart-ness on this occasion..” 

 On Saturday the 12th of May 1917 Rowland Ding set out to test a B.E.2c. as he had done many times before. What is known as fact is that Ding set off from the Soldiers field shortly after 6 PM and flew away from the park telling those present he was going to have a quick test before taking the inspector up for the official test flight. When he was clear of most of the houses by the park he executed a loop and appeared to try and enter a second loop when the wings of the plane suddenly collapsed. The plane began to fall from the sky as Rowland desparately fought for control (later the control cables and the tubes they sat in would be found to be distorted as they had been pulled so hard in an effort to gain control) As the plane fell towards the ground it’s been suggested that a fire had already started but certainly by the time it crashed at the gates of a house just off Oakwood Lane it was ablaze and it was only due to the swift actions of Major Secker-Walker, a Doctor, that Rowland’s body was pulled free from the wreckage before the 20 feet high flames engulfed it. The air speed indicator was jammed at 120 knots. 

The Leeds Mercury newspaper wrote on the 14th May: 

“..Mr W. Rowland Ding, the well known Yorkshire pilot, met his death whilst flying at Roundhay, Leeds, early on Saturday evening. 
 Mr Ding was testing a biplane, and hundreds of spectators in the Roundhay area were watching the flight. He had looped the loop perfectly once with the machine, and was apparently attempting  another loop when it appeared to the spectators that one of the wings suddenly collapsed.

 The biplane, completely out of the aviators control, dived to earth, and before reaching the ground the horrified spectators saw that it had taken fire. It fell in a field near to the residence of Mr A. G. Lupton, at Roundhay. 

 Mechanics and policemen hurried to the spot and Mr Ding’s dead body was found amid the charred wreckage of the machine. 

 The news of the accident was received with sorrow in the Roundhay district and in Leeds, where the aviator was a well known and popular figure.

 Mr Ding, who was thirty-one years of age, was one of the best known civillian aviators in the North of England. He was a pilot of exceptional skill, and he had experience with all classes of machines. The accident is inexplicible to those who know the skill of the aviator.

 For three years he had been engaged testing machines in Yorkshire. At one time he had an aviation school at Windermere and he gave exhibition flights at Harrogate and other places. He was a generous friend and concientous and absolutely fearless at his work.

 An inquest will be held today..” 

A correspondant wrote to the Yorkshire Evening Post on the 14th May: 

 “..In the suburb of Roundhay, where his name is a household word, the hope uppermost in everybody’s mind on Saturday night was that death came quickly to Rowland Ding – that he was saved the torture of the flaming petrol as he fell  with his broken and burning aeroplane to the ground. Most of us who were familiar with him as a symbol of aerial adventure had never spoken to him; indeed, the majority had probably seen no more of his figure than the speck of his head showing from the pilot’s seat. But he was as an old friend. There was a friendly ring about his name. “Ding” was in great letters on the under side of the wings of his first monoplane, and when the insistent drone his engine was heard as we sat in house or garden it invariably drew from us  - “Ding is out again” or, from the more frivolous of us “More Dinging – look out for him” 
 His death is a mere incident in this great tragedy of the war, but it brought to we unhappy onlookers of his end the meaning of that phrase we see almost daily  in the messages from the belligerents General Headquaters  - so many aeroplanes “driven down out of control” 

 In his case it had probably been mere light-heartedness. He had looped so frequently, both on biplanes, and lately even on his new monoplane. We thought nothing of these aerial somersaults on a biplane, for the new type looks strong enough to stand any amount of tumbling, with it’s bamboo struts, it’s bracing and it’s general appearance of solidity. But when, about a week ago, some of us saw him turn his new monoplane over in a loop, we wondered at his accession of confidence; before, he had been so careful in this type of machine. Whether it was part of his duty as a tester of aeroplanes we know not, but in these green spring days he flew and looped as if for gladness. 
 On Saturday night, he came around to his usual quarter of the heavens for looping – away to the east of Roundhay Park, where the houses are few and the green turf spreads afar. We supposed it was his accustomed prudence. If he was careless of his own life, he did not risk others. He habitually refused to take passengers unless all the conditions were favourable, and every time I saw him loop it was over land where, if anything went wrong, there were few roads and little chance of hurting anybody. 

 When I saw him on Saturday night he had just done one loop and was planing down to get speed up for another, and I watched with some anxiety how sluggishly the machine described the first half of the arc. It went up laboriously. Usually Ding has gone round with apparent ease, taking the loop as it were in his stride, the machine gliding back to it’s normal position smoothly and without strain. Now instead of taking a graceful curve, the machine seemed to fall over as the nose came round to the horizonal; I may be wrong but it looked like a short fall, nose down, and a quick and jerky flattening out. It was a relief to see this flattening out, with complete reassurance as straightaway another dive was started as if to loop again. But in light of the sudden stagger, and the horifying spectacle of a wing breaking away, then the collapse of all the planes , and the nose dive to earth with streaming smoke. I wonder if all was right when the machine came out of the second loop.
 Had that jerky flattening out broken and essential part of the structure and was the machine out of control when the dive was started which we onlookers thought was going to end in another loop? If this was so then Ding may have foreseen what was to follow. It is consoling however, to reflect that those few seconds must have been crowded with intent to right the aeroplane, and that, if the published experiences of airmen at the front are any guidance, Ding was scarecly aware of his last fall before the end came.

 It is an unpleasent experience to see a man die in mid-air in this way. There is a feeling of helplessness. Nothing can be done. The collapse of the wings mean nothing can save him, that the crash to earth is inevitable – and on Saturday night thousands of people witnessed with sinking hearts the whole tragedy

 Rowland Ding was about 31 years of age, married with two children. He was an experienced pilot and looked the typical airman – of small stature, quick movement, aquiline nose, with all the characteristics of a man accustomed to observe closely and make quick decisions. He was very popular at the Blackburn Aeroplane works..”  

 In The Olympian magazine, internal magazine of Blackburn Aircraft Company, a conversation Rowland once had with his mother was remembered: 

“..It was to his dear mother he opened his heart freely on the perils of his chosen profession. Once when she was deeply concerned for his safety he said to her: “Well, Mother, if I am killed you will always know that I have done my duty for the advancement of aviation and my duty to my country. And” he would add in solemn tones “if I have to go, I would prefer that sudden ending to a lingering bed of sickness. What does it matter? It isn’t as if this is the end of all existence, is it dear?” 

 This conversation, which occurred in their sweet home at Manordilo in South Wales, is eloquent of the spirit of the man..” 

 The Olympian also reported that Ding may have had some sort of premonition that something was going to happen that day: 

“..It is a peculiar conincidence that on the very evening prior to his mishap Ding also discussed with a certain naval officer the risks he had to face daily.

 He declared that he had been in five bad smashes in the course of his career and endured all the pains and suspense to be expected in a fatality and, as he added, “it didn’t seem so bad as one might expect, so there is nothing to worry about.”

 In the same conversation our late pilot related that whenever he was going to have a smash he invariably dreamt of it the night before. There is no absolute record to show that he had any clear premonition of his death before the 12th ; but if this was the case his undertakings of that last flight bespeaks a marvellously cool courage, and it may possibly explain why the acceptance officer did not accompany Ding on the journey..”  

 An eyewitness suggested, in The Olympian, that Ding may even have tried to save his life after the wing collapsed, by aiming for tall trees on Oakwood Lane, using the rudder for control. It was clarified in ‘The Olympian’: 
	
“..An examination of the wreckage did show that the rudder had been forced hard over, for a turnbuckle on the right rudder cable had jammed into one of the copper carrier tubes in the framework of the fusilage..” 

The inquest was reported in the Leeds Mercury on the 15th May: 

“..The story of a well known aviators death was told at an inquest held at the Mansion, Roundhay, Leeds yesterday. Mr W. Rowland Ding, who was killed while flying at Roundhay on Saturday. 
 The Coroner (Mr P. P. Maitland) at the outset expressed deep sympathy with the deceased’s relatives remarking that his death had been a loss to the country. The just concurred and passed a resolution of sympathy with the relatives. 

 Mr Reginald Heber Mason of Harrogate stated that Mr Ding, who was his brother in-law, had been a certified air pilot for over four years. He had been staying at the Queens Hotel, Leeds but his home address was 113 River View gardens, Barnes, London. He was a married man. 
 The witness in answer to the Coroner said that Mr Ding was healthy and had exceptionally strong nerves. 

 Horation Henry Goodyear, a foreman erector of aircraft, said Mr Ding was an experienced pilot. The biplane was a new one and had been examined by the firm’s inspectors earlier in the day. The machine was quite in order when Mr Ding took it for a trip. He climbed to the height of about 1500 feet, and then banked very considerably. He afterwards looped the loop once and then the wings on one side of the machine collapsed. 

 In answer to the coroner, witness said that excessive banking would put extra strain upon the machine. It was not necessary to bamk or loop the loop to test a machine.
 
 The managing director of the firm that made the aeroplane, said that it was not wise to loop the loop with a new machine. It was possible to strain the machine looping the loop and if Mr Ding had not done it he would probably not have been killed. Looping the loop was one of Mr Ding’s methods of testing a machine. They had great admiriation for Mr Ding, and on behalf of the firm and it’s workers expressed sympathy with his relatives also did the coroner and jury.
 
 Major H. Secker Walker R.A.M.C outside whose house the machine fell said that when the machine fell to the ground there was an explosion. Mr Ding must have been killed instantaniously. 
 The Coroner said it was evident that Mr Ding was an aviator who could hardly go without doing some fancy flying. The jury recorded a verdict of ‘accidental death’..” 

 Almost immediately rumors started to circulate that there was something unusual about the plane that Rowland was killed in. Specifically that it had been an experimental version of the B.E.2c adapted to produce more power. In flight magazine it was reported as follows: 

“..Mr W. Rowland Ding who has long been known in connection with British aviation, was killed while testing a biplane in Yorkshire on May 12th. It is reported that he was looping the loop at some 3000 feet when the wings came adrift.

 Mr Ding will be remembered by the earlier ferverants of aviation as a constructor of models in conjunction with Mr. W. H. Sayers, the Ding-Sayers models being notable for their inherant stability when flying, and their strong construction. Later on the partners endeavoured to build a full-sized machine at Brooklands but funds to complete it were not available. Mr Sayers continued to work in aeroplane construction with various firms, and to study the scientific side of aviation with marked success. 

 Mr Ding later learned to fly and became an expert pilot. Before the war he flew the first Handley Page biplane. Soon afterwards he formed the Northern Aircraft Co. Ltd., on Windermere and opened a water-plane school. This firm went into liquidation last year, and Mr Ding took up testing various makes.

 It is not known officially on what machine he met his death, but it is said he was flying a B.E. fitted, according to the desires of Government experts with an engine of considerably higher power than it was originally designed to carry..” 

This claim eventually reached parliament and in May of 1917 a question was asked about the crash. The answer given didn’t reveal anything more about the plane and suggested it wasn’t altered. 

“..Mr. Billing asked whether a civilian aviator, Mr. Roland Ding, recently killed
in Yorkshire by the breaking of his machine in the air, was flying a B E biplane
or an aeroplane of Government design; if it was a B E biplane or other
machine of Government design ; whether it was fitted with an engine of
a higher power than the machine was originally designed to carry ; whether the
B. E. biplane was originally designed for a 100 horse-power engine; whether
it was first sent on active service with only a 70 horse-power engine ; whether
it is still sent on active service with only a 90 horse-power engine ; whether it
has been found to be safe to fly with an engine of 150 horse-power ; whether such
power is being fitted to this type in order to attain a reputation for Government
official design ; and whether, in view of the recent fatality occasioned by this,
he will now cause this practice to be discontinued ?

Major Baird : The aviator referred to was in the private employment of a
firm of aeroplane constructors, but I understand that he was flying a B E 2
machine with a 90 horse-power R.A.F. engine, which is the type for which it
was originally designed. The answer to the fourth, fifth, and sixth parts of the
question is in the affirmative, and to the seventh part in the negative. The
last part of the question, therefore, does not arise..”

 When Robert Blackburn’s wife Jessica died in 1995 the incident is mentioned in her obituary where the plane is curiously again described as ‘experimental’:


“..In 1917, the Blackburn test- pilot Roland Ding (sic) crashed to his death in an experimental plane in Roundhay Park in front of a horrified crowd of on-lookers..”

 Later that year the staff of Blackburn funded the erection of a large bronze plaque featuring the face of Ding which was installed at the gates of the Olympia Works in Roundhay. 

This wasn’t the only legacy of Ding at the Olympia Works factory - His dog Paddy, a brindle Terrier who had joined him on many flights became the guard dog of the factory and was said to be exceptionally good at his job – sometimes challenging workers he was otherwise friendly with if they turned up at unusual hours! He became known for catching the tram outside the factory at lunch to go and see various butchers who would feed him scraps. He died in 1925 and was written about in the Yorkshire Evening Post on the 21st November:       

“..In “The Olympian” magazine of the Blackburn Aeroplane Works in Leeds, mention is made of the passing of Paddy, the watchdog of the works. 

 A brindled bull-terrier of extraordinary intelligence, Paddy was deeply attached to his first master, the late Rowland Ding, and often flew with him when his master went up as a test pilot for the firm during the war. When his master was killed in a flying accident on May 12th 1917, Paddy was about four years old, and he had formed an insepperable connection with the works.
 
 He was given to another master by Mrs Ding but soon appeared back at Olympia and seemed determined to stay; so the firm adopted him and gave him a roving commission with the duties of a watch-dog at night. 

 Paddy seemed to know every single man in the place and would soon confront a stranger at the gate; after working hours he would growl at anybody who tried to get in, whether friend or stranger. On being given the word he would go the round of the factory by himself – this was proved by following his tracks in the snow – and he was an excellent ratter. 

 He delighted in rides of any sort of vehicle, particularly trams and lorries, and would often board a tram at the works and go for a ride to Harehills or Sheepscar. Sometimes he would return with a large lump of meat as an addition to his larder..”
