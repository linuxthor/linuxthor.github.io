        <p>Notes for those attending the Bluetooth Workshop at SteelCon</p>

<div class="post">
        <p>Thanks for signing up to attend the Introduction to Bluetooth Hacking workshop! I've had one or two questions so thought
        I'd put a short post together to collect all the answers in one place. <p>

        <h3><b>What will we cover?</b></h3>
        This course is a short one hour workshop to introduce people to Bluetooth hacking. The aim is to introduce you to the methods that
        may be used to discover devices, dicover services available on those devices and ways to attack those services. There will be demos,         practical exercises and a competition where you may be able to win an exciting prize!
        <p>
        <h3>Although this workshop isn't hugely theory based there will be some printed material given to you illustrating the layers of the 
        Bluetooth stack, security mechanisms etc which should hopefully address some of those areas if you decide to look further into Bluetooth.
        <p>

        <h3><b>What do I need to bring?</b></h3>
        At a minimum you simply need to bring yourself, however to get the most from the workshop you should bring a laptop running
        Linux. Debian is ideal as thats what I use and I'm confident the examples should work well. You will be provided with a basic Bluetooth         dongle which allows it's address to be manipulated which is useful for certain attacks I'll demonstrate and is yours to keep.
        <p>
        <h3>Software-wise you should have installed the bluez development packages which on Debian should be as simple as:
        <pre><code>
        sudo apt-get install bluez-utils libbluetooth-dev
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Or follow the instructions at <a href=http://www.bluez.org/download/>bluez</a>
        <p>
        <h3>In addition standard tools such as gcc and make should be present. 
        <p>

        <h3><b>Is there anything else I might optionally bring?</b></h3>
        <h3>Not as such but if you have an Ubertooth One then bring that along (<i>although one of these may or may not be the prize alluded to above        ;-) <i>) An 802.11 wireless card capable of monitor mode is also handy to have.
        <p>

        <h3><b>Do I need any previous experience?</b></h3>
        <h3>The intended audience is anyone who has an interest in this area but not a huge amount of experience. This is to say that this is an introductory
        workshop.
        <p>

        <h3><b>Will we be writing code?</b></h3>
        <h3>While there will be some deconstruction of specific tools/techniques at a code level there won't be much actual code written in the workshop. Material
        provided on the day should guide you further in this direction if you want to make your own tools from scratch.
        <p>

       <h3><b>Can I come to both the morning and the afternoon workshop? Are they the same?</b></h3>
       <h3>On this occasion the content is the same in both the morning and the afternoon session.
