	<h1>Pi Zero W Monitor Mode</h1>
	<p>A short writeup of how to get wireless monitor mode working on the Raspberry Pi Zero W</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
	<p>Recently I bought a Rasperry Pi Zero W from <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/">Pimoroni</a> and was excited to discover that 
     the wireless chipset is the same  CYW43438 wireless chip as the Raspberry Pi 3, providing 802.11 wireless and bluetooth 4.0 
     connectivity. I've previously had success using <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon">nexmon</a> on the Pi 3 to
     enable monitor mode with radiotap headers and construct a portable wireless analyser (which you can read about <a href="">here</a>) 
     so I assumed it should be possible to build the same nexmon software on the smaller Raspberry Pi Zero W and turn the Pi Zero W
     into (probably) the worlds smallest wifi sniffer!<p>
     <p>Looking at open pull requests in the nexmon project I saw that Github user <a href="https://github.com/NoobieDog/nexmon">
     NoobieDog</a> had already submitted patches that adjust the Makefiles to add support for the ARM6 based Pi and these worked 
     well with a few small adjustments:<p>
     <pre><code>
     if foo == bar
         bar = foo
     </code></pre>
