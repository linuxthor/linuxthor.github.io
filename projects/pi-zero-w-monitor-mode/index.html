	<h1>Pi Zero W Monitor Mode</h1>
	<p>A short writeup of how to get wireless monitor mode working on the Raspberry Pi Zero W</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
	<p>Recently I bought a Rasperry Pi Zero W from <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/">Pimoroni</a> and was excited to discover that the wireless chipset is the same  CYW43438 wireless chip as the Raspberry Pi 3, providing 802.11 wireless and bluetooth 4.0 
           connectivity. I've previously had success using <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon">nexmon</a> on the Pi 3 to
           enable monitor mode with radiotap headers and construct a portable wireless analyser (which you can read about <a href="">here</a>) 
           so I assumed it should be possible to build the same nexmon software on the smaller Raspberry Pi Zero W and turn the Pi Zero W
           into (probably) the worlds smallest wifi sniffer!<p>
           <p>Looking at open pull requests in the nexmon project I saw that Github user <a href="https://github.com/NoobieDog/nexmon">
           NoobieDog</a> had already submitted patches that adjust the Makefiles to add support for the ARM6 based Pi and these worked 
           well with a few small adjustments. <p>
	   The build process was:
           <pre><code>
	   # become root
	   sudo -i
	   # ensure packages are up to date
           apt-get update 
	   apt-get upgrade
	   # install prerequisites 
	   sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers git libgmp3-dev gawk
	   # grab a copy of nexmon
	   git clone https://github.com/NoobieDog/nexmon.git
	   cd nexmon
	   # setup env for build
	   source setup_env.sh
	   # "Compile some build tools and extract the ucode and flashpatches 
	   # from the original firmware files"
	   make
	   # compile patched firmware
	   cd patches/bcm43438/7_45_41_26/nexmon/
	   make
	   # backup existing firmware then install new 
	   make backup-firmware
	   make install-firmware
	   # build nexutil
	   cd utilities/libnexio/
	   make
	   cd utilities/nexutil/
	   make
	   make install
           </code></pre>
	   Unfortunately when I tried to build nexutil (used to switch in and out of monitor mode) I got an error 
	   <p>
